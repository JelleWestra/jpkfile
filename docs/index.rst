   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to jpkfile's documentation!
===================================

jpkfile is a module for reading of data archives recorded with `JPK Instruments <http://www.jpk.com/>`_.  
I am sorry for the lack of comments and documentation. This project is in a very early stage. Instead, you can have a look at the file in the ``examples`` folder.
